function [signal,state] = flt_repair_bursts(varargin)

% [Signal,State] = flt_repair_bursts(Signal,StandardDevCutoff,WindowLength,BlockSize,ProcessingDelay,MaxDimensions,SpectralParameters,CalibPrecision,UseGPU,ReferenceExtraction,State)
%
% This is an automated artifact rejection function that ensures that the data contains no events
% that have abnormally strong power; the subspaces on which those events occur are reconstructed 
% (interpolated) based on the rest of the EEG signal during these time periods.
%
% The basic principle is to first find a section of data that represents clean "reference" EEG and
% to compute statistics on there. Then, the function goes over the whole data in a sliding window
% and finds the subspaces in which there is activity that is more than a few standard deviations
% away from the reference EEG (this threshold is a tunable parameter). Once the function has found
% the bad subspaces it will treat them as missing data and reconstruct their content using a mixing
% matrix that was calculated on the clean data.
%
%
% In:
%   Signal : Continuous data set, assumed to be appropriately high-passed (e.g. >0.5Hz or with a 
%            0.5Hz - 2.0Hz transition band)
%
%   Cutoff : Standard deviation cutoff for removal of bursts (via ASR). Data portions whose variance
%            is larger than this threshold relative to the calibration data are considered missing
%            data and will be removed. The most aggressive value that can be used without losing too
%            much EEG is 2.5. A very conservative value would be 5. (default: 5)
%
%
%   The following are detail parameters that usually do not have to be tuned. If you cannot get
%   the function to do what you want, you might consider adapting these better to your data.
%
%   WindowLength : Length of the statistcs window, in seconds. This should not be much longer 
%                  than the time scale over which artifacts persist, but the number of samples in
%                  the window should not be smaller than 1.5x the number of channels. 
%                  (default: max(0.5,1.5*Signal.nbchan/Signal.srate))
%
%   StepSize : Step size for processing. The reprojection matrix will be updated every this many
%              samples and a blended matrix is used for the in-between samples. If empty this will
%              be set the WindowLength/2 in samples. (default: 1/3)
%
%   ProcessingDelay : Signal delay, in seconds. This can be anywhere between 0 and WindowLength/2;
%                     if this is too low some sharp-onset artifacts will leave brief "knacks" in the
%                     data. (default: 0.125).
%
%   MaxDimensions : Maximum dimensionality to reconstruct. Up to this many dimensions (or up to this 
%                   fraction of dimensions) can be reconstructed for a given data segment. This is
%                   since the lower eigenvalues are usually not estimated very well. Default: 2/3.
%
%   SpectralParameters: Parameters for the spectrum-shaping filter that reweights frequencies
%                       according to their relevance for artifact detection. This is a cell
%                       array of {Frequencies,Amplitudes,Order} for a Yule-Walker IIR filter
%                       design. Note: These settings may give you a different frequency response from
%                       what you expect, so check what you generate. Also, the default value is not 
%                       recommended for >512Hz sampling rate. 
%                       (default: {[0 2 3 13 16 40 80],[3 0.75 0.33 0.33 1 1 3],8})
%
%   CalibPrecision : Block size for calculating the robust data covariance, in samples; allows to 
%                    reduce the memory requirements of the robust estimator by this factor (down to
%                    Channels x Channels x Samples x 16 / Blocksize bytes). The value is further
%                    incremented if necessary to fit the data in memory. (default: 10).
%
%   UseGPU : Whether to run on the GPU. Makes sense for offline processing if you have a GTX 780 or 
%            better. Default: false
%
%   ReferenceExtraction : Group of sub-parameters to control how clean reference data shall be extracted 
%                         for calibration of the statistics (these are arguments to flt_clean_windows).
%
%       PowerTolerances: The minimum and maximum standard deviations within which the power of a channel
%                        must lie (relative to a robust estimate of the clean EEG power distribution in 
%                        the channel) for it to be considered "not bad". Default: [-3.5 5.5].
%
%       MaxBadChannels : The maximum number or fraction of bad channels that a retained window may still
%                        contain (more than this and it is removed). Reasonable range is 0.05 (very clean
%                        output) to 0.3 (very lax cleaning of only coarse artifacts). Default: 0.15.
%
%   State : previous filter state, as obtained by a previous execution of the filter on an immediately 
%           preceding data set. If this is a string of the form ".fieldname" for a valid field name
%           in the input data set, the function will take this as its initial state and not
%           calibrate again. This is useful for carrying resting-state calibration over into a
%           regular BCILAB analysis, e.g. a cross-validation. (default: [])
%
% Out:
%   Signal : data set with local peaks removed
%
%   State  :  state of the filter, after it got applied
%
% Notes:
%   When used online, this function gives slightly different results from offline processing since
%   parameters are also updated at the beginning and end of each chunk; therefore, transitions can be 
%   as short as the chunk length. The behavior should nevertheless be qualitatively equivalent to
%   offline processing.
%
% Examples:
%   % use the defaults
%   eeg = flt_repair_bursts(eeg);
%
%   % use a 1-second window length and 0.5 seconds delay / look-ahead (e.g. for very high channel counts)
%   eeg = flt_repair_bursts('Signal',eeg, 'WindowLength',1, 'ProcessingDelay',0.5)
%
%   % use some very aggressive settings (not generally advisable)
%   eeg = flt_repair_bursts('Signal',eeg, 'StandardDevCutoff',2.5,'MaxDimensions',0.75);
%
%   % use a very conservative setting
%   eeg = flt_repair_bursts(eeg,4);
