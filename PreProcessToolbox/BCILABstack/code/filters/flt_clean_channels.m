% Remove channels with abnormal data from a continuous data set.
% Signal = flt_clean_channels(Signal,MinCorrelation,IgnoredQuantile,WindowLength,MaxBrokenTime,Rereferenced)
%
% This is an automated artifact rejection function which ensures that the data contains no channels
% that record only noise for extended periods of time. If channels with control signals are
% contained in the data these are usually also removed. The criterion is based on correlation: if a
% channel is decorrelated from all others (pairwise correlation < a given threshold), excluding a
% given fraction of most correlated channels -- and if this holds on for a sufficiently long fraction 
% of the data set -- then the channel is removed.
%
% In:
%   Signal          : Continuous data set, assumed to be appropriately high-passed (e.g. >0.5Hz or
%                     with a 0.5Hz - 2.0Hz transition band).
%
%   MinCorrelation  : Minimum correlation between a channel and any other channel (in a short period 
%                     of time) below which the channel is considered abnormal for that time period.
%                     Reasonable range: 0.4 (very lax) to 0.6 (quite aggressive). (default: 0.5). 
%                     
%
%   The following are "detail" parameters that usually do not have to be tuned. If you can't get
%   the function to do what you want, you might consider adapting these to your data.
%   
%   IgnoredQuantile : Fraction of channels that need to have at least the given MinCorrelation value
%                     w.r.t. the channel under consideration. This allows to deal with channels or
%                     small groups of channels that measure the same noise source, e.g. if they are
%                     shorted. If many channels can be disconnected during an experiment and you
%                     have strong noise in the room, you might increase this fraction, but consider
%                     that this a) requires you to decrease the MinCorrelation appropriately and b)
%                     can make the correlation measure more brittle. Reasonable range: 0.05 (rather
%                     lax) to 0.2 (very tolerant re disconnected/shorted channels).The default is
%                     0.1.
%
%   WindowLength    : Length of the windows (in seconds) for which correlation is computed; ideally
%                     short enough to reasonably capture periods of global artifacts (which are
%                     ignored), but not shorter (for statistical reasons). (default: 2)
% 
%   MaxBrokenTime : Maximum time (either in seconds or as fraction of the recording) during which a 
%                   retained channel may be broken. Reasonable range: 0.1 (very aggressive) to 0.6
%                   (very lax). (default: 0.4)
%
%   Rereferenced    : Whether the measures should be computed on re-referenced data. This can improve 
%                     performance in environments with extreme EM noise, but will decrease robustness 
%                     against individual channels with extreme excursions. (default: false)
%
%   LineNoiseAware : Whether the operation should be performed in a line-noise aware manner. If enabled,
%                    the correlation measure will not be affected by the presence or absence of line 
%                    noise. (default: true).
%
%	ProtectChannels : list of channel names (cell array) that should be protected from removal. 
%                     (default: {})
%
% Out:
%   Signal : data set with bad channels removed
%
% Examples:
%   % use with defaults
%   eeg = flt_clean_channels(eeg);
%
%   % override the MinimumCorrelation and the IgnoredQuantile defaults
%   eeg = flt_clean_channels(eeg,0.7,0.15);
%
%   % override the MinimumCorrelation and the MaxIgnoredTime, using name-value pairs
%   eeg = flt_clean_channels('Signal',eeg,'MinimumCorrelation',0.7, 'MaxBrokenTime',0.15);
%
%   % override the MinimumCorrelation and the MaxIgnoredTime, using name-value pairs 
%   % in their short forms
%   eeg = flt_clean_channels('signal',eeg,'min_corr',0.7, 'max_broken_time',0.15);
