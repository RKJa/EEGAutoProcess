function result = par_evaluate(task__)
% Internal: Task processing function of the worker.
% Result = par_evaluate(Task)
%
% Both the task and the result are assumed to be in serialized form, and this function deserializes
% the task, evaluates it, and re-serializes the results.
%
% In:
%   Task : task record; A sequence of bytes which represents a cell array of the form: 
%          {Number, Function, Arugment1, Arguments2, ...} where Number is an arbitrary task 
%          number, Function is the function to evaluate, and ArgumentX are arguments to the function.
%
% Out:
%   Result : result record; A sequence of bytes which represents a cell array of the form:
%            {Number, ResultData} where Number is the corresponding task number and ResultData is 
%            the first output of the function.
%
%            If an exception happened during processing, result represents {Number, LastError} where
%            LastError is an error record as returned by lasterror.
%
% Notes:
%   Depending on the severity of the error (especially when the serialization itself fails), the 
%   error record may contain an inaccurate number or just a string as error
%   record.
