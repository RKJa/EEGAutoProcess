% In:
%   Id : scheduler id, obtained from par_beginschedule

% Out:
%   Results : cell array of results of the scheduled computations (evaluated strings)
%   Errors  : cell array of {position,exception struct} for those results that could not be evaluated
%             the position may also be unknown in case of more severe errors
