function par_clearworkers(hostnames)
% Clear workers from the listed hostnames (or if those are unspecified, from the current pool).
% par_clearworkers(Hostnames)
%
% Note: this function erases all of the user's MATLAB processes on the given nodes; if there are
% unrelated MATLABs running, these will also be killed. This may also shoot down the master process
% itself if it is located on one of the unfortunate machines...
%
% In:
%   Hostnames : cell array of hostnames on which to acquire workers (duplicates and port assignments
%               will be ignored).
%
% Example:
%   % clear all workers on the given machines (of this user)
%   par_clearworkers({'computer1','computer2','computer3'})
