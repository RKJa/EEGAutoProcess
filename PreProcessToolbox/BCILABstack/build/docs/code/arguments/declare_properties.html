 declare_properties('Property',value,'Property',value, ...)

 This construct can be used to declare any key-value properties for a function. It must not follow
 after a call to arg_define() but before it. These properties can then be retrieved using
 arg_report('properties',@myfunction).

 BCILAB looks for certain properties in filter (signal processing) and dataset editing functions
 (and possibly other functions in the future), to support improved integration of these functions 
 into the GUI and the evaluation system. See flt_pipeline for more details.

 In:
   Options...: list of name-value pairs.

               Ordering hints applicable for filters (respected by flt_pipeline) are the following:
                'depends': expresses that some other filter(s) *must* have been called before running 
                           the filter whose properties are being declared (this is usually due to some 
                           required meta-data that is supplied by that other filter)
                'cannot_follow': expresses that the filter being declared cannot follow after some 
                                 other filter(s) (this is usually due to destructive
                                 editing performed by those other filters)
                'cannot_precede': expresses that the filter being declared cannot precede some 
                                  other filter(s)
                'follows': expresses that the filter being declared *prefers* to follow some 
                           other filter(s) (this is usually for numeric or efficiency reasons)
                'precedes': expresses that the filter being declared *prefers* to precede some 
                           other filter(s) (this is usually for numeric or efficiency reasons)

               Optional properties respected by the evaluation system (for improved usability):
                'independent_channels': specify that this filter does not transfer information
                                        across channels (e.g. channel selection, FIR filter)
                                        (allows the online system to auto-infer which data channels 
                                        are actually required by a given BCI model)
                'independent_trials': specify that this filter does transfer information
                                      across second-length or larger time scales (on the order of 
                                      the duration of a trial or larger); this determines whether
                                      the filter will be called repeatedly for each partition of the 
                                      data in a cross-validation and other offline analyses

               Further optional properties include:
                'name': specify the GUI/human-readable name of this function
                'experimental': whether the function implementation is experimental or otherwise 
                                in &quot;prototype&quot; stage
                'deprecated': whether the function is deprecated

 Examples:
   function myfunction(...)

   % declare a property called 'name', and assign the string 'MyFunction' to it, and another
   % property called 'price', with some value attached
   declare_properties('name','MyFunction','price',1999)

   % in a signal processing function, declare the name of the function as it should appear in the 
   % GUI panel (default is the name of the file without the flt_ / set_ prefix)
   declare_properties('name','MyFilter')

   % in a signal processing function, declare that the filter depends on two other (previously applied)
   % filters (here: flt_ica and set_fit_dipoles)
   declare_properties('depends',{'flt_ica','set_flt_dipoles'});
   
   % in a signal processing function, declare a hint that the filter typically follows some other 
   % filter in the pipeline (if that other filter was enabled; here: flt_resample)
   declare_properties('follows','flt_resample');

   % in a signal processing function, declare a hint that the filter typically precedes some other 
   % filters in the pipeline (if that other filter was enabled; here: flt_iir and flt_fir)
   declare_properties('precedes',{'flt_iir','flt_fir'});

   % in a signal processing function, declare the constraint that the filter cannot follow some other 
   % filter
   declare_properties('cannot_follow','set_makepos');

   % in a signal processing function, declare the constraint that the filter cannot follow some other 
   % filter
   declare_properties('cannot_precede','set_makepos');

   % in a signal processing function, declare that the contents of each output channel produced 
   % by the filter depend only on the contents of the corresponding input channel (i.e. there is not
   % cross-mixing of channels (default is false)
   declare_properties('independent_channels',true);

   % in a signal processing function, declare that the contents of each output trial depend not
   % only on data of the respective input trial, but perhaps on other trials, as well (i.e., there is 
   % cross-mixing over time at trial granularity); the effect of this is that the respective filter
   % will be executed once per cross-validation fold
   declare_properties('independent_trials',false);
