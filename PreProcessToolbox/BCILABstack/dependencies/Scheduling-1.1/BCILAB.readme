Scheduling / Distributed computing support functionality for BCILAB; requires MATLAB 2007b+.

To rebuild, type the follwing in the comamnd line (assuming that /path/to/bcilab is the path to your BCILAB distribution).
  cd /path/to/bcilab/dependencies/Scheduling-1.0
  javac -classpath /path/to/bcilab/dependencies/matlabcontrol-4.0.0/matlabcontrol-4.0.0.jar Scheduler.java

  Note: you need at least matlabcontrol-4.0.0 (earlier versions have a threading bug that prevents this from working correctly).
