This Java package from Joshua Kaplan (Brown University) allows to call MATLAB from Java, via the JMI interface. Since JMI is undocumented,
there may be problems with this package in some MATLAB configurations; please check for updates on http://code.google.com/p/matlabcontrol/

See http://undocumentedmatlab.com/blog/jmi-wrapper-local-matlabcontrol-part-1/ for an explanation.
