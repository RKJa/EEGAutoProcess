This is a slightly modified version of DAL:
* A function named "dalsqds.m" has been added, which implements dual-spectral regression.
* The function ds_dnorm., now uses norm(), which doesn't require PROPACK.
* The function svdmaj.m now uses pca.m instead of lansvd, which is faster.
* Fixed a bug in hessMultdalds.m regarding large blocks (with incomplete SVD's)
* Optimized some code in hessMultdalds.m
