This folder contains a Matlab interface for the c-port by Naoaki Okazaki 
(http://www.chokkan.org/software/liblbfgs/) of the lbfgs code
by Jorge Nocedal (http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgs.html),
with the addition of the Orthant-Wise Limited-memory Quasi-Newton algorithm
due to Galen Andrew and Jianfeng Gao. See references below.

To install:

1. Download liblbfgs
2. Make necessary modification in make.m such that the files "lbfgs.c" and "lbfgs.h" (and optionally files for SSE optimziations)
   can be found. This should normally just be to change the "library_path"-variable.
3. Run make.m in Matlab

If liblbfgs is compiled outside Matlab, then the installation procedure looks as follows:

1. Download liblbfgs
2. Follow instructions to compile liblbfgs
3. Make necessary modification in make.m such that the library can be found
4. Run make.m in Matlab

(Note that it is currently assumed that lbfgsfloatval_t coincide with matlabs double.)


Run example.m for an example.

Tested with liblbfgs v.1.9 and Matlab R2010a and R2008a, 32-bit, on Windows Vista
and Matlab R2011a on Windows 7 64-bit and MSVC++ 2010 express with Windows SDK 7.1

Update history:

7/12 2011:
Modified the file "make.m" so as to make more compilation options available

21/2 2011: 
Changed the name of the file "make.m" to "build.m"
Changed in lbfgs.c so that the solver always returns the current value of x at exit
Changed "max_iterations" to "MaxIter" to comply with fmincon synatax

TODO: Make sure input validation is not duplicated
TODO: Improve documentation
TODO: lbfgs returns the zero vector if the minimzation fails for some reason,
      should (whenever appropriate) return the current value of x
TODO: Make sure we don't get into trouble by mixing double and lbfgsfloatval_t
TODO: Return gradient at x
TODO: Display function should be written in Matlab
