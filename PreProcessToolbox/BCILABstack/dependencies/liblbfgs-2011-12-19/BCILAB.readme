This is a minimally modified version of the LBFGS interface package by Arne Vagren. It now uses C-style comments instead of C++ comments and the function
was renamed to liblbfgs to sidestap name clashes with other implementations on the path.

Included here is a minimally modified version of the LBFGS solver liblbfgs-1.10 by Naoaki Okazaki (itself a port of original code by Jorge Nocedal).
The fix defines the "inline" keyword which doesn't exist in ANSI C and some issue with stdint.h.
